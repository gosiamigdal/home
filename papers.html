                                    The aim of this study was to investigate of combining effect of acute tryptophan depletion and biperiden on human memory. These medicines were chosen because of their effect on either the serotoninergic or cholinergic system which we know are involved in cognitive processes. I discovered e.g intresting effect, which these medicines has on P600 peak. In papers you will find all the details.

I used to work at Laboratory of Psychophysiology, leaded by professor Anna Grabowska. <br>Along with other researchers we have been investigating false recognition. It is one form of misattribution, where individuals mistakenly claim that a novel item or episode is familiar. It can be investigated with eeg which allow us to see time course of this kind of mistakes. This kind of examination investigate event-related potentials, which are potentials correlated with events such as perception of word or picture. The aim of our study was to investigate of false recognition of highly emotional picture stimuli. All of the details and diagrams are described in paper.</div>

I conducted this study on 120 participants and I received interesting results. <br>I found, that people who are more introvert, evaluate smells of rose, musk and pear as weaker, then people, who are less introvert. I discovered, that people who are more neurotic, perceive smell of mint as weak and calming. In the paper you will find all the other interesting results and brief history of smell research.</div>
